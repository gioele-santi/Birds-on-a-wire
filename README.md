# Godot Wild Jam 21
My entry for 21 st Godot Wild Jam - Theme **connection** + *2 buttons* wild card (I hope also juicing, but we will see)

## Synopsis

Some birds are flying around and they may interrupt an important **connection** established through a wire.
Your task is to protect the precious wire from all those birds. All that weight may break it.

## Controls
Only 2 buttons: Q and W on your keyboard. Shoot from left or right.
