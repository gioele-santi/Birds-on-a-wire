# GodotWildJam21
Game for 21 st Godot Wild Jam - Theme connection + 2 buttons wild card (I hope also juicing, but we will see)

## Synopsis

Some birds are flying around and they may interrupt an important **connection** established through a wire.
Your task is to protect the precious wire from all those birds. All that weight may break it.

Controls only 2 buttons: Q and W on your keyboard. Shoot from left or right.
